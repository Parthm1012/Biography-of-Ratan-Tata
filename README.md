AIM: Choose a theme (e.g., comic book, magazine, etc.) for your 5-6 page design using Adobe Photoshop.
TASK TO BE DONE: Design 5-6 visually consistent and creative pages based on your theme.
Tools & Techniques: Use various Photoshop tools like layers, filters, text effects, and document them.
STEP BY STEP GUIDE:
1. Plan the Content and Layout
•
Outline the biography: Break down the content into six sections (e.g., early life, education, career highlights, personal achievements, challenges, etc.).
•
Determine the visual style: Decide on fonts, color schemes, image placement, and any design elements (borders, icons, or patterns).
•
Page dimensions: Choose the size of the book (e.g., A5, A4, or custom size). Ensure consistency for all pages.
2. Set Up the Document
•
Create a new file: Go to File → New. Set the document size (e.g., 8.27 x 11.69 inches for A4) and resolution (300 DPI for print quality).
•
Set Margins and Guides: Use rulers (Ctrl + R) and guides to ensure consistent margins and alignment throughout the pages.
3. Design the Cover (Page 1)
•
Create the front cover: Use attractive fonts for the title of the biography and add a subtitle if necessary.
•
Add a photo: Include an image of the person (centered or off-center based on your design) on the cover.
•
Design elements: Add shapes, borders, or decorative elements to make the cover appealing. Keep it simple and visually impactful.
4. Create Inside Pages (Pages 2–5)
•
Text and Images Layout:
o
For each page, create a layout combining text and images.
o
Add 2–3 images per page to break the text and enhance visual appeal.
o
Use Text Tool (T) to add your written biography content in appropriate font sizes (e.g., 14-18pt for body text, 24-30pt for headers).
•
Consistency: Use consistent fonts, spacing, and alignment across all pages.
•
Visual Elements: You can add page numbers, decorative lines, or other graphic elements to keep it cohesive.
5. Design the Back Cover (Page 6)
•
Add additional details: This could include a short blurb about the biography or a quote from the person.
•
Author information or publishing details: Add your name, logo (if relevant), and publishing date.
•
Simplified design: Keep the back cover less busy than the front, with a focus on text.
6. Finalizing and Saving
•
Check for consistency: Review font sizes, alignments, and the overall flow of text and images.
•
Save as PSD: Keep the layers editable by saving the project as a PSD file (File → Save As).
•
Export for Print: When finished, export the file as a PDF or image format for printing (File → Export → Export As or Save a Copy).
o
Choose PDF with print settings to maintain high resolution.
